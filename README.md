# Database Attacking

### Main:
Created a SQL DB and plan on trying to attack it using various methods. My attack VM will be my Kali Linux through VirtualBox. I also created a firewall using Ubunutu Server VM.

### Reasoning:
I did this project because I'm studying for my CySA+ certification exam and needed to brush up on some firewall log readings and attacking methods.


### Future:
I would like to include an open source SIEM to read the logs after extracting them.


#### Checklist of things I've done:

- [x] Created Kali Linux VM
- [x] Created Ubuntu VM
- [x] Set up firewall with Ubuntu Server
- [ ] Start researching on attack methods
- [ ] Extract firewall logs and use them in a SIEM
